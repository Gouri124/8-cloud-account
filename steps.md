I signed my Microsoft Azure Account by the following procedures

This guide will walk you through creating an Azure account using a Credit Card.
Goal:Get $200 USD (or equivalent) credit + 12 months of free services.

Prerequisites:A valid Microsoft Account (Outlook/Hotmail), a Mobile Phone, and a standard Credit Card (Visa/MasterCard/Amex).

Step 1:Go to the Official Sign-Up Page
       Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
       Go to azure.microsoft.com/free
       Click on the green "Start free" button.
       Warning: Do not click "Pay as you go" or "Buy now." You want the specific "Free Account" offer.

Step 2:Sign In / Create Identity
       Sign In:You will be prompted to log in.Use your existing Microsoft email (e.g., user@outlook.com).
       If you don't have one: Click "Create one!" to set up a new email address instantly.
       Profile Info: Fill in the "About you" section:
       First & Last Name: Must match your ID/Credit Card exactly.
       Email: Your main email.
       Phone: Your mobile number.

Step 3:Identity Verification (Phone)
       Select your country code (e.g., +91 or +1).
       Enter your mobile number.
       Click "Text me".
       Enter the 6-digit verification code you receive via SMS.

Step 4:Identity Verification (Credit Card)
       This is the most critical step where most users face issues.
       Select "Credit/Debit Card" as the payment method.
       Enter Card Details:Card Number, Expiry Date, CVV.
       Cardholder Name:Enter it exactly as it appears on the physical card.
       Address:Ensure the billing address matches the address your bank has on file.
       Verification Charge:Microsoft will charge a temporary authorization hold (approx. $1 USD or ₹2 INR).
       This is NOT a fee.It is just to check if the card is active. It will be refunded/reversed automatically within 3-5 days.Click Next/Verify.

Troubleshooting Tip: If your card is declined, ensure International Transactions are enabled on your card. Prepaid cards (and some debit cards without international capability) are often rejected.

Step 5:Final Agreement
       Check the box that says "I agree to the Microsoft Customer Agreement."
       (Optional) Uncheck the box for marketing emails if you don't want them.
       Click the "Sign Up" button.

Step 6:Confirmation
       Wait for the "Setting up your account..." screen to finish.
       You will be redirected to the Azure Portal (https://www.google.com/search?q=portal.azure.com).
       Look for a notification (bell icon 🔔) in the top right corner. It should say: "Successfully signed up. You have $200 credit remaining."
       Immediate Next Step: Set a Budget Alert
       To ensure you never accidentally get charged after your free credit runs out, do this immediately:
       In the Azure Portal search bar (top), type "Cost Management + Billing".Select "Budgets" (on the left menu).Click "Add".
       Set a budget amount of $0 (or ₹1).Configure it to email you if costs exceed 1% (which means as soon as you start spending even a penny).
