Cloud Service Providers Basic Informations

1.Microsoft Azure
  
  What it includes:
    $200 Credit: To be used on any Azure service for the first 30 days.
    12 Months Free: Access to popular services (e.g., 750 hours of B1s Virtual Machines, 250GB SQL Database) for the first year.
    Always Free: 55+ services are free forever (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB, App Service F1 tier).
  Duration: 
    30 days (for the $200 credit) + 12 months (for popular services).
  Key Limitations:
    Identity Verification: A credit card is mandatory; prepaid cards are often rejected.
    Region Limits: Free tier Virtual Machines (VMs) and specific services may only be available in certain regions (e.g., US East).

2.AWS (Amazon Web Services)

  What it includes:
    Free Credits: New accounts (as of late 2025) typically receive $100 USD in credits upon sign-up, with the potential to earn another $100 by completing specific     tasks (like launching an instance).
    Always Free: Access to limited tiers of services that never expire (e.g., 1 million AWS Lambda requests/month, 25GB DynamoDB storage).
    Legacy/Specific Tiers: While the model has shifted toward credits, "Always Free" limits still apply to specific services to prevent credit drain.
  Duration:
    The free account plan typically lasts 6 months or until your credits are exhausted, whichever comes first.
  Key Limitations:
    Credit Card Required: You must provide a valid credit/debit card for identity verification.
    Cost Traps: Once credits are gone or the 6-month window ends, you are charged standard rates immediately.

3.Google Cloud Platform (GCP)   

  What it includes:
    $300 Credit: A flexible credit to use on any Google Cloud service.
    Always Free: A highly popular offering that includes an e2-micro VM instance, 30GB of Standard persistent disk, and 5GB of snapshot storage per month.
  Duration:
    90 days (for the $300 credit). The "Always Free" resources are indefinite.
  Key Limitations:
    Strict Region Limits: The free "e2-micro" VM is strictly limited to specific US regions (e.g., us-west1, us-central1). Using other regions will cost money.
    Credit Expiry: Any unused portion of the $300 is lost after 90 days.
